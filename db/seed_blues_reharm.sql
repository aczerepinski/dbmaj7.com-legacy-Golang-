    '[{"body":"If you aren''t familiar with reharmonization, it essentially means to replace some of the chords in a song. Typically this is done without requiring any changes to the original melody, although small chromatic adjustments aren''t unheard of.","order":1,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"The 12 bar blues is a particularly good vehicle for exploring reharmonization techniques because it''s a universally known song form, and reasonably close to a blank canvas. In fact, the 12 bar blues gets reharmonized so frequently that it would be difficult to pin down what the actual \"standard\" chords are. There''s definitely a subdominant chord in the 5th bar and a dominant in the 9th - but beyond that, it''s anybody''s call. As such, the \"Standard Blues\" chords in this article may vary from one example to the next.","order":2,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"The first technique we''ll discuss is demonstrated in Charles Mingus''s Nostalgia in Times Square:","order":3,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"musicalExamples":[{"chords":[["I7"],["IV7"],["I7"],[]],"defaultKey":"Eb","measureNumber":1,"title":"Standard Blues"},{"chords":[["I7","bVII7"],["I7","bVII7"],["I7","bVII7"],["I7","bVII7"]],"defaultKey":"Eb","measureNumber":1,"title":"Nostalgia in Times Sq."}],"order":4,"templateName":"reharmWidget"},{"body":"Looking first at the standard blues chord progression, it alternates between Eb7 and Ab7 - chords that function as tonic and subdominant respectively.","order":5,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"Mingus does something very similar in Nostalgia in Times Square, except he replaces the subdominant IV7 chord (Ab7) with bVII7 (Db7). bVII7 is sometimes referred to as a dominant chord, but since lacks the leading tone (D-natural), it can just as easily function as subdominant.","order":6,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"That functionality is at least preserved enough so that the resulting chord progression is still identifiably a blues. The bVII7 chord has a very rich blues sound because its 7th (C-double-flat!) is a \"blue note\" in the song''s key of Eb. Mingus puts a #9 on the Db chord as well, which is an additional blue note in the key of Eb.","order":7,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"The next technique we''ll look at comes from Charlie Parker''s Blues for Alice:","order":8,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"musicalExamples":[{"chords":[["I7"],["IV7"],["I7"],["II/IV","V7/IV"],["IV7"]],"defaultKey":"F","measureNumber":1,"title":"Standard Blues"},{"chords":[["IMaj7"],["II/VI","V7/VI"],["VImin7","V7/V"],["II/IV","V7/IV"],["IV7"]],"defaultKey":"F","measureNumber":1,"title":"Blues for Alice"}],"order":9,"templateName":"reharmWidget"},{"body":"Beginning in bar 2, we see a series of II-V progressions that descend by a full step each measure. The intent makes sense if you look at the prototypical IV7 chord that this pattern brings us to in bar 5.","order":10,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"There are a couple interesting things about this progression. For one, the move from a tonic I chord down a half step to Emin7 is fresh and unexpected. Secondly, the reharmonized progression begins with chromatic tension that is slowly released from bars 2 to 5. This occurs because Emin7 and A7 have several notes that are not diatonic to the home key of F. Advancing to bar 3, Dmin7 and G7 have fewer non-diatonic notes, which reduces chromatic tension. By bar 4 and 5, we''re solidly back in the chord/scale universe of an F blues.","order":11,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"If you want to use this technique on your own, remember to work backwards from a solidly diatonic target chord. Also, give a listen to Charlie Parker''s Confirmation, which is a very famous (non-blues) example of this same progression.","order":12,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"The final example we''ll look at is the turnaround from Joe Henderson''s Isotope:","order":13,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"musicalExamples":[{"chords":[["I7","V7/II"],["IImin7","V7"]],"defaultKey":"C","measureNumber":11,"title":"Standard Blues"},{"chords":[["I7","V7/II"],["subV7/IV","subV7/II"]],"defaultKey":"C","measureNumber":11,"title":"Isotope"}],"order":14,"templateName":"reharmWidget"},{"body":"Isotope''s 11th bar is unchanged from a standard blues - it begins with the tonic C7 chord, and moves down a minor-third to V7 of II.","order":15,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"After that, rather than following the expected resolution to IImin7, Henderson instead makes a pattern out of the minor third root movement. He descends another minor third to Gb7 and yet another to Eb7, outlining the notes of a diminished seventh chord.","order":16,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"This technique is sometimes called ''constant structure''. It involves moving (transposing) a chord or a voicing ''as-is''. In this case, Henderson uses a sequence of seventh chords, but the technique could be applied with a sequence of any arbitrary chord type.","order":17,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"One of the interesting things about constant structure progressions is that traditional roman numeral analysis doesn''t really apply. The A7 chord doesn''t really function as V7/II - it''s just a dominant chord that wants to resolve somewhere.","order":18,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"Our ears are so accustomed to turnarounds at the end of a song form that we''ll accept almost any four chords in those final two bars. In this case, seventh chords provide the tension we need, and the descending minor third pattern leads nicely back to I7 at the top of the form.","order":19,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"If you want to use this example as inspiration for creating your own turnaround, try the ''constant structure'' approach of using only one chord type - for example only minor chords, or only major seventh chords. The chords don''t need to be diatonic for it to work.","order":20,"templateName":"articleParagraph"},{"body":"If you enjoyed this article, please share it and help us grow.","order":21,"templateName":"articleParagraph"}]',
